# Image-Processing
## Project Summary:
I created an image processing program implemented in the _Image-Processing file. The _Image-Processing file contains 3 main classes. 
The first is RGBImage which creates a template of RGB color images with methods such as getting the size of an image, getting a deep copy of an image's pixel matrix,
and getting the color of a pixel at a particular row and column. The second is ImageProcessing which processes images using methods such as cropping an image, rotating
an image by 180 degrees, and tinting an image. The third is ImageKNNClassifier which predicts the label of a particular image using K-nearest-neighbors utilizing methods such as storing training data, calculating distances between two images, and getting the most popular image label candidates. 

Class creation along with a conceptual understanding of how images are formed was essential knowledge for creating this project.
